#  Netflix Content Analysis with Python

This project provides an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Netflixâ€™s catalog using Python. It explores trends in content type, release year, regional availability, genres, duration, and more.

The aim is to derive actionable insights from Netflix's global streaming data using visualization and data wrangling techniques.

##  Project Objective

To understand **what type of content Netflix offers**, how it varies across countries and time, and what patterns exist in terms of genres, ratings, and duration. This analysis helps answer questions like:

- What types of content (Movies vs TV Shows) dominate the platform?
- Which countries produce the most content for Netflix?
- Which years saw the most content added?
- What are the most popular genres and ratings?
- What are the typical durations of shows or movies?
